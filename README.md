📌 About This Repository

This repo is my personal log of solving the Apna College DSA Sheet—one problem each day for 90 days. Every problem is approached with three strategies: brute force, better, and optimal.

📅 90-Day Progress Tracking

Day 1: Solved a problem

Day 2: Loading...

Day 3: Loading...

... (Tracking continues for all 90 days)

🚀 Challenge Approach

Each day, I tackle one problem.

I implement three solutions: brute force (naive), an improved approach, and the optimal solution.

The focus is on consistency and learning.

💡 Why This Matters

The goal isn’t just problem-solving—it’s building daily discipline, mastering DSA concepts, and preparing for technical interviews.
